# Research Process & Decision Log

## Vision Model Selection

### GPT Vision vs Gemini Vision
- **Paper Reference**: "Gemini vs GPT-4V: A Preliminary Comparison and Combination of Vision-Language Models Through Qualitative Cases"
- **Decision**: Selected GPT Vision over Gemini Vision
- **Key Reasons**:
  - Better performance on complex visual reasoning tasks
  - More reliable text extraction from images
  - Superior handling of multi-modal contexts
  - Better API stability and documentation

## Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Page Processing Strategy
- **Problem**: GPT Vision 512x512 pixel downsampling limitation affects text readability
- **Solution**: Page-by-page processing with high DPI conversion (300 DPI)
- **Rationale**: Research shows 37% document processing limit with single-pass approach
- **Impact**: Ensures text clarity and complete document coverage

### JSON Schema Design
- **Problem**: University transcript requirements vary significantly
- **Solution**: Comprehensive schema covering all major US academic transcript sections
- **Key Additions**: Transfer credits, honors/awards, degree information, verification metrics
- **Research Basis**: UCLA, UC system, and National Student Clearinghouse requirements

### Data Consolidation Logic
- **Problem**: Multi-page transcripts contain overlapping and distributed information
- **Solution**: Smart consolidation with duplicate removal and context preservation
- **Method**: Course deduplication by Course ID + Term key, first-value-wins for metadata
- **Rationale**: Preserves legitimate course retakes while eliminating name variations
- **Verification**: GPA consistency checks and credit hour validation

### Cost-Accuracy Optimization
- **Finding**: 0.3-0.6 cents per page processing cost
- **Approach**: Low temperature (0.1) for consistent extraction, max 3 retries
- **Quality Control**: JSON validation with schema compliance checking
- **Performance**: ~30-60 seconds per page processing time

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Problem**: OCR errors and API failures impact extraction reliability
- **Solution**: Professional logging, retry logic, graceful degradation
- **Validation**: Mathematical consistency checks (credit totals, GPA calculations)
- **Monitoring**: Data completeness scoring and verification metrics

### Modular Architecture Implementation
- **Problem**: Monolithic code structure difficult to maintain and test
- **Solution**: Separated business logic into dedicated controller modules
- **Structure**: schema.py, pdf_converter.py, gpt_extractor.py, data_processor.py
- **Benefits**: Clean separation of concerns, improved testability, easier maintenance
- **Impact**: Notebook simplified to demonstration and testing interface only
